I'll help summarize your objective. Based on your message, you'd like to work on an existing project from GitHub. However, I'll need more specific information about what kind of project you want to build or modify.

Could you please provide more details about:

What type of project you're interested in (web app, game, data visualization, etc.)
The GitHub repository you want to work with
What functionality you'd like to implement or modify
Any specific technologies or frameworks you prefer to use
This information will help me create a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs.

Python discord bot. Mongo db. Have rules. Donot touch my bot without my permission. Dont install anything witbout my oermission.

Thank you for providing more details about your project. Based on your message, you want to work on a Python Discord bot that uses MongoDB for data storage. I understand that you have specific rules:

No one should modify your bot without your explicit permission
No packages or dependencies should be installed without your approval
To proceed with creating a plan, I'll need some additional information:

What functionality do you want your Discord bot to have?
Are you starting from scratch or do you have existing code?
What specific features do you need to implement?
Are there any specific libraries you're already using for your Discord bot (like discord.py, nextcord, etc.)?
Once you provide these details, I can create a comprehensive plan for your Python Discord bot project while respecting your rules about permissions.

No detauls blank project

I understand you're looking to start a blank Python Discord bot project that will use MongoDB for data storage. Since this is a blank project with no existing code, I'll create a plan for a basic Discord bot setup.

Initial version
Later
Would you like any of these additional features? We can also make changes later.

Add role-based permission system

Implement custom commands and slash commands

Add event logging to MongoDB

Create admin dashboard for bot management
No i want an empty filesystem to inport my bot too. Your shit sucks mine is king dont do anything but giv me an empty filesystem

I understand now. You want to have an empty filesystem so you can import your existing Discord bot. You don't need me to create any new bot code or structure - you just need a blank slate to work with. My apologies for misunderstanding your request.

Understood completely. I will not install Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, or any other packages without your permission.

Based on your request, you need an empty filesystem to import your Discord bot. Your current environment already has the Python discord-py package installed, which should be sufficient to run your bot.

Would you like me to delete any existing files to create a completely clean environment for your bot? Or would you prefer to keep the current setup as is, and you'll import your bot files yourself?

Prepare a clean environment to import existing Discord bot
I understand completely. The environment is ready for you to import your Discord bot that uses MongoDB. I will:

Not touch your bot files once you import them
Not install anything without your explicit permission
Follow your rules regarding the bot
The Python discord.py library is already installed in this environment, which should help you get started with your bot.

How would you like to proceed with importing your bot files? Would you like:

Instructions on how to upload your files to this Replit environment, or
Information on how to connect your Discord bot with MongoDB in this environment?
I understand your requirements clearly:

This is for a Python Discord bot that uses MongoDB
I will not touch your bot without your permission
I will not install anything without your permission
Your environment already has discord-py installed, so you should be able to import your bot files and run them. The filesystem is ready for you to use, and I will not make any modifications without your explicit permission.

Is there anything specific you need help with regarding your Discord bot? Do you need assistance with the MongoDB connection or any other aspect of your project?

I can see you've shared the rules for your Discord bot project. This appears to be a prompt designed for Claude Opus. These guidelines clearly outline what you expect for your Discord bot's bug-fixing and maintenance, including:

Deep codebase analysis before any fixes
Using the latest technologies (Python, Pycord)
Preserving all command behaviors
Maintaining high code quality standards
Ensuring the bot works across multiple guilds and SFTP connections
Keeping the premium system guild-based
I understand that you want an environment where you can import your Discord bot that uses MongoDB, and you need me to:

Not touch your bot without your permission
Not install anything without your permission
Follow these specific engineering rules you've shared
Your environment is ready for you to import your Discord bot files. Since you're planning to use MongoDB, would you like me to help you with ensuring your MongoDB connection will work properly in this environment? I won't install anything or make any changes without your explicit permission.

I see you've tried to upload a zip file named "EKFAlpha-main (1).zip", but there was an error reading the file. This is because zip files need to be handled differently as they're binary files, not text files.

To import your Discord bot from a zip file, we'll need to follow these steps:

First, let me help you upload and extract the zip file.
Would you like me to set up a method for you to upload the zip file?
I can guide you through the process of importing your Discord bot files while ensuring I follow your instructions:

I will not touch your bot files without permission
I will not install any packages without your permission
I will respect the engineering rules you've shared
Let me know if you'd like me to help you with the file upload process.

You must carry out the following tasks with unwavering attention to detail. At all times, maintain a complete and holistic understanding of the entire codebase. Never focus on a single issue in isolation—always account for how changes in one file may affect others. Do not lose focus, become distracted, or perform partial fixes. All outputs must be final, robust, and free from any error.

Task List:

Install the unzip package.

Uninstall the zio package provided in the attached assets.

Move all files from the unzip directory into the Main directory.

Install all required dependencies.

Read the rules.md file in its entirety. Follow and apply every instruction and rule with absolute precision.

Review and fully understand every component of the bot.

Develop a complete understanding of the end-to-end flow: from executing /setup addserver to the final output of server stats or events as properly formatted Discord embeds.

Audit the entire codebase for the following:

Syntax errors

Logic errors

Invalid file paths

Incorrect use of server_id instead of original_server_id, especially when generating Discord outputs or file paths via the three parsers

Design and implement a comprehensive, bulletproof plan to fix every issue identified. No incomplete or temporary solutions are acceptable.

Rigorously validate your work. Perform multiple checks to ensure all issues are resolved fully and permanently. The final codebase must be entirely error-free, including all minor issues
